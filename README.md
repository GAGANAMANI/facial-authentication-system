# Facial Authentication System

This project implements a simple web-based facial authentication system using OpenCV.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Face registration and authentication
- Basic liveness detection using eye blink
- Rate limiting to prevent repeated authentication attempts

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Flask
- Haar Cascade Classifiers

## Purpose
This project was developed strictly for educational purposes as part of a Cyber Security internship to demonstrate biometric authentication concepts and basic anti-spoofing techniques.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: `opencv-python`, `flask`
2. Run face registration script
3. Run authentication script
4. Perform liveness check

## Disclaimer
This system is not intended for production use.
